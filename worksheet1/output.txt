A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that follows the heap property. In a heap, the value of each node is compared 
Common heap operations are:
contains the maximum value. As you move down the tree, the values decrease.
Extract Max/Min: Removes the maximum or minimum element from the heap and returns it.
Heapify: Converts an arbitrary binary tree into a heap.
Heap Operations
Insert: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
Max Heap: The root node contains the maximum value, and the values decrease as you move down the tree.
Max-Heap: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, ensuring that the root node
Min Heap: The root node contains the minimum value, and the values increase as you move down the tree.
Min-Heap: The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children, ensuring that the root node contains
the minimum value. As you move down the tree, the values increase.
There are two main types of heaps:
This property guarantees that the largest (in a max-heap) or smallest (in a min-heap) value is always at the root, and the 
to the values of its children in a specific way:
tree maintains a specific order based on the type of heap.
